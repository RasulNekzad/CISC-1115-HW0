# HW4

This program involves overloading methods used for printing different types of arrays, and calls to those methods. 

The basicArray method declares and initializes an array and prints its elements.

There are three printElements methods, each printing the entries of different types of arrays.
In order to use the printElements method to print arrays of Time objects, a Time class has been defined to create Time objects.
