# Program1

This program intakes an input file containing integers and computes the following:

Factorial: For each input, calculate its factorial value.  For example, an input of 6 would result in 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 2 * 1 = 720.

Sum of Squares: Calculates the sum of squares for a number series ending in the input. For example, an input of 6 would result in 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 = 91.

Fibonacci Sequence: Takes an input number and prints the fibonacci sequence for that number's amount of the sequence.  For example, an input of 6 would result in 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
