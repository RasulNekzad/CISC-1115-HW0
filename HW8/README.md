## Program 1
This program intakes text files from the command line and prints the word count of each file using a for-loop to iterate through the files and a while loop to keep track of the word count.  

Sample text files (generated using lorem ipsum) have been provided to showcase the program.

## Program 2
The purpose of this program is to create a functioning calculator which can perform simple arithmetic calculations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  

The program requires input from a user, which is verified for validity and evaluated based on its operator.  It accepts input regardless of how it's entered, so long as it follows the conventions of a proper expression.  For example, "7*3" and " 7 * 3 " are both accepted as proper inputs.  Separate methods, isValid and containsOperator, are defined to aid in verifying the validity of the entered expression.
