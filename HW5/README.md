# HW5

The aim of this program is to prepare a report containing information on distance traveled for different types of vehicles based on their speed and time traveled obtained from an input file, utilizing two separate methods:

1. The distance method intakes values for speed and time and outputs the distance traveled at each hour interval based on speed.  

2. The saveAsFile method receives a String variable (in this case the type of vehicle) and prepares a text file for that input.  

The results of the distance method are printed into the PrintStream file created by the saveAsFile method using a for loop.  This is done for every type of vehicle in the initial input file, "vehicle-info.txt".
